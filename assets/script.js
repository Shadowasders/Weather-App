/*Things to add!
Intregrate Dayjs
Intregrate weather API
add functionality to search button (eventListener on click)
use local storage to save past searches and add them below search bar (see previous classes for this? Unsure)
popluate empty divs w/information on search button press (use for loop for buttons, how to add to the next day in a for loop?) 
find way to use the lil weather emojis for each type of weather, and figure out how to add them into the JS (insert, modify, append? where to find them to link w/webpage?)
once js is functional style site*/
